# TaskFlow

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **TaskFlow**, a project I'm really excited about. It's a full-stack project and task management system built with ASP.NET Core Web API and Blazor WebAssembly. I built TaskFlow to sharpen my backend skills, and it serves as a showcase of what I can do on the server side with .NET.

## Overview
TaskFlow is my attempt to blend a solid backend with a smooth front-end experience. At its core, TaskFlow lets you manage projects and tasksâ€”create projects, add tasks, assign statuses, and more. This project is perfect for showing off real-world .NET backend skills.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: CRUD operations for Projects and Tasks.
- **EF Core Integration**: Data persistence with SQLite.
- **Swagger UI**: Built-in API documentation and testing interface.
- **Blazor WebAssembly Client**: A modern front-end connected to the API.
- Ready for expansion: Authentication, real-time updates with SignalR, etc.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8 via Snap)
- **Frontend**: Blazor WebAssembly
- **Database**: SQLite with Entity Framework Core
- **Tools**: Swagger for API docs, EF Core Migrations, Git & GitHub for version control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK (installed via Snap)
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.)
